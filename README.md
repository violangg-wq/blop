Interior Decor Game (AIP Widgets-style)
--------------------------------------

This project is a custom recreation inspired by:
https://aipwidgets.click/decor_game/interior_decor_game.html

It attempts to use the AIP Widgets runtime if available by including:
  <script src="https://aipwidgets.click/aipwidgets.js" defer></script>

If the runtime isn't accessible (CORS / network / missing), the included
local shim (aipwidgets-shim.js) provides a tiny compatible API so the demo works.

Files:
- interior_decor_game.html  (open in a browser)
- styles.css
- app.js
- aipwidgets-shim.js
